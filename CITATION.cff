abstract: >
  OpenPDAC is an OpenFOAM module based on the module
  multiphaseEuler, distributed with OpenFOAM.


  With respect to the original module, in OpenPDAC the
  equations from the kinetic theory for granular flows are
  modified to model multiple dispersed solid phases.


  In addition, a Lagrangian library is included in the model
  (one-way coupling with the gas-solid mixture).
